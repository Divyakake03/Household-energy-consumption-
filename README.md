- **Records:** 100000 measurements  
- **Features:** Date, Time, Global active power, Global reactive power, Voltage, Global intensity, and sub-metering values.  

---

## Objectives
- Analyze household energy consumption trends over time.  
- Identify peak energy usage hours and seasonal variations.  
- Build machine learning models to predict future electricity consumption.  
- Compare model performances and evaluate accuracy.  

---

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, resampling by day/hour, feature scaling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Trends, peak usage hours, correlation analysis, seasonal patterns.  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Extracting day, month, weekday/weekend, and lag features.  
4. **Model Building** â€“ Implemented and compared models such as:  
   - Linear Regression    
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Metrics: MAE, RÂ² Score.  

---

##  Results
- **Peak Usage Hours:** 6 PM â€“ 9 PM.  
- **Best Performing Model:** Mean Absolute Error MSE=  
- **Insights:** Significant seasonal variation in energy usage (higher during winters due to heating).
